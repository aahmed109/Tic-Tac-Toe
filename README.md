# Tic-Tac-Toe
This game is made using Assembly Language 
The code runs only in emu8086, I don't know why
it does not work properly in DOSBox or in any other 
media. 

As it runs in emu8086, it takes a lot of time to 
draw everything, especially the main grid. If you 
want to avoid this time consumption, comment out 
the line "call draw_grid" in main procedure, it will 
not hamper the logic or other process of the program.
